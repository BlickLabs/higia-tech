        "desc": "40% of the female population in the USA and 80% of the female population in Asian countries have high breast density, which means that they have from 2 to 6 times more likelihood of developing breast cancer throughout their lifetime. Furthermore, dense tissue \"masks\" tumors in the breast by making it harder for physicians to differentiate between healthy tissue and abnormal masses. Likewise, a study conducted with more than 70,000 patients in the Netherlands showed that the sensitivity of the mammogram was reduced by 29% in women with high breast density. Also, studies have shown that tumors in dense breast tissue might progress more rapidly than those in fatty breasts. In conclusion, there are 23.1 million women in the US alone that 1) have a higher risk of developing breast cancer and 2) tumors would grow more aggressively in their breasts and are the ones least likely to benefit from a mammogram.",
        "subtitle": "How we aim to solve this",
        "descTwo": "The detection of breast cancer through the analysis of thermal patterns inside the breast has proven to be agnostic to tissue density. This means that a device like EVA can detect tumors with the same sensitivity and specificity in women with high breast density as in those with fatty breast tissue. EVA can become an important adjunctive tool for breast cancer screening in populations with high breast density. Studies have shown that thermographic screening methods combined with mammogram tests can lead to a joint sensitivity of 95%.",

It's important to clarify that the mammogram has not been shown to be clinically beneficial or cost-effective in the evaluation of breast symptoms in women under the age of 35. This means that just in the US, 51.6 million women aged 25 to 40 do not have access to the only method that has been clinically proven to reduce breast cancer mortality rates, in other words, they are excluded from the breast cancer screening guidelines.",
        "descTwo": "Early breast cancer detection in young women remains one of the main challenges for effectively fighting this disease. The World Health Organization predicts that the incidence of breast cancer in young women will increase by 50% by 2035, and reports that, currently, 7% of breast cancer cases are women younger than 40 years of age. Young women are more likely to have high breast density, be diagnosed at more advanced stages, have a survival rate of less than 5 years, and have no access to a reliable method of breast cancer screening.",
        "subtitle": "How we aim to solve this",
        "descThree": "The mammogram is not available for young women due to concerns relating to prolonged exposure to radiation and its low sensitivity with the high breast density common in this age group. Contrary to the mammogram, EVA does not emit any type of ionizing radiation nor compress the mammary gland in any form, as well as being non-invasive and completely pain-free. This allows us to be an age-agnostic adjunctive screening technique that can be used by any woman since age 20."

Low socioeconomic status is a consistent marker of mammogram underuse: 70% of breast cancer cases in developing countries like Mexico are in stage III and IV, which are stages that reduce the survival rate to just 25%. This can be explained by the fact that breast cancer in young women is more common in developing countries (accounting for 35% of all cases) and since there is no reliable method for breast cancer screening, only 5-10% of the diagnostics occur in the early stages.",
        "descTwo": "Women above 40 years of age in developing countries rarely have access to quality mammograms due to high infrastructure costs and lack of access to cost-effective transportation to hospitals and clinics with the adequate equipment.",
